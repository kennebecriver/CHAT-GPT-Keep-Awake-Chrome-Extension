# CHAT-GPT-Keep-Awake-Chrome-Extension
This is a Chrome extension that sends a request to https://chat.openai.com/backend-api/conversation every 50 seconds to prevent the OpenAI chat from forgetting your IP address and constantly asking for a Cloudflare check. The script runs automatically when a tab with https://chat.openai.com/ is open in the browser.
